# dxtoolkit

> [!CAUTION]

> This project is now in long-term stasis. If you are using the dxtoolkit today, we recommend that you adopt Data Control Tower (DCT) and migrate your automation to the [DCT Toolkit](https://help.delphix.com/dct/current/content/dct_toolkit.htm). The dxtoolkit was a key input into the introduction of the fully Delphix supported DCT Toolkit.

## What is it

Dxtoolkit is a set of scripts, which are delivered by Delphix professional services team.
Dxtoolkit scripts look and feel like UNIX executables, following the typical conventions of using flags for arguments.  Dxtoolkit is written in Perl, but no knowledge of Perl is required unless you want to extend it.  In fact, no programming experience whatsoever is required to use the dxtoolkit.

## What's new

Please check a [change log](https://github.com/delphix/dxtoolkit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for list of changes.

## How to get started
### Compiled version

Download a compiled version of DxToolkit for required platform from a [releases  page](https://github.com/delphix/dxtoolkit/releases).
Create a configuration file *dxtools.conf* based on dxtools.conf.example or a Wiki page.

Check a [documentation](https://github.com/delphix/dxtoolkit/wiki) for more details


### Docker image

Run dxtoolkit using a docker image:
1. Create configuration file *dxtools.conf* based on dxtools.conf.example or a Wiki page.
2. Run a docker image with the following parameters:
  * path redirection: `-v /path/to/your/configfile:/config`
  * image name: `pioro/dxtoolkit:develop`
  * `dxtoolkit_command dxtoolkit_command_params`


   ex: `docker run -v /configdir:/config pioro/dxtoolkit:latest dx_get_appliance -d myengine`


### Source version

Perl version 5.16 or higher

**Required packages**
- JSON
- Date::Manip
- DateTime::Event::Cron::Quartz
- DateTime::Format::DateParse

### Known issues

There is no script dx_syslog on Windows and AIX due to lack of support of Log::Syslog::Fast Perl module


### Support matrix

New releases of dxtoolkit are tested with Delphix Engines, which are in primary or extended support.
Ex. 2.4.14 release was tested with version 5.3.9 and 6.0.X engines.

Dxtoolkit is designed to support many versions of Delphix Engines, although if a new version is released after dxtoolkit release
it may stop working due to API changes. To mitigate this issue until next dxtoolkit version will be release, please add
-dever parameter to your commands with the following values:

|parameter|Delphix Engine version|API version|
| :---    |     :---:            | :---      |
| -dever 6.0.11| Delphix Engine 6.0.11 | API 1.11.11|
| -dever 6.0| Delphix Engine 6.0 | API 1.11.00|
| -dever 5.3| Delphix Engine 5.3 | API 1.10.00|
| -dever 5.2| Delphix Engine 5.2 | API 1.9.00|
